# LearningLens Deployment Fix Instructions

This package contains fixes for the runtime errors encountered on Render deployment. The main issues were related to database initialization and error handling.

## Files Included

1. `app.py` - Fixed application file with proper directory creation and error handling
2. `templates/404.html` - Template for 404 error pages
3. `templates/500.html` - Template for 500 error pages

## How to Apply These Fixes

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Update

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/ssetuae/learninglens-app
2. Navigate to the `app.py` file and click the edit button (pencil icon)
3. Replace the entire content with the content from the fixed `app.py` file
4. Commit the changes with a message like "Fix runtime errors"
5. Create a new folder called `templates` in your repository if it doesn't exist
6. Upload the 404.html and 500.html files to the templates folder

### Option 2: Local Clone and Push

1. Clone your repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ssetuae/learninglens-app.git
   ```
2. Replace the app.py file with the fixed version
3. Create a templates directory and add the error template files
4. Commit and push the changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix runtime errors"
   git push
   ```

## Deployment on Render

After applying these fixes, Render should automatically detect the changes and redeploy your application. If it doesn't:

1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Navigate to the learninglens-app service
3. Click the "Manual Deploy" button and select "Deploy latest commit"

## What These Fixes Address

1. **Database Initialization**: The original code was trying to create a database without ensuring the directory existed first
2. **Error Handling**: Added proper error templates and handlers for 404 and 500 errors
3. **Application Startup**: Changed the database initialization to use Flask's before_first_request decorator

## Verifying the Fix

After deployment, visit https://learninglens-app.onrender.com to verify that the application is working correctly. You should be able to access the site without any HTTP errors.

If you continue to experience issues, check the Render logs for any new error messages.
